# Which platforms to examine?

We need to figure out which platforms (outside of human, mouse and rat) would have decent amounts of data to examine. The other big possibililties are of course:

*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*
*Caenorhabditis elegans*
*Drosophila melanogaster*
*Arabidopsis Thaliana*
*Xenopus laevis*
*Plasmodium / Anopholes Gambiae*
*Danio rerio* - this might be more difficult without the data automatically in 
Bioconductor, but could still be done

All of the above except D. rerio have CDF files on Bioconductor, and really, we can get almost anything we want off of the Affymetrix(r) website.
